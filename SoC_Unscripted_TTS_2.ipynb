            "Truth: President Bok, former President Rudenstine, incoming President Faust, members of the Harvard Corporation and the Board of Overseers, members of the faculty, parents, and especially, the graduates: I’ve been waiting more than 30 years to say this: “Dad, I always told you I’d come back and get my degree.” I want to thank Harvard for this timely honor. I’ll be changing my job next year … and it will be nice to finally have a college degree on my resume. I applaud the graduates today for taking a much more direct route to your degrees. For my part, I’m just happy that the Crimson has called me “Harvard’s most successful dropout.” I guess that makes me valedictorian of my own special class … I did the best of everyone who failed. But I also want to be recognized as the guy who got Steve Ballmer to drop out of business school. I’m a bad influence. That’s why I was invited to speak at your graduation. If I had spoken at your orientation, fewer of you might be here today. Harvard was just a phenomenal experience for me. Academic life was fascinating. I used to sit in on lots of classes I hadn’t even signed up for. And dorm life was terrific. I lived up at Radcliffe, in Currier House. There were always lots of people in my dorm room late at night discussing things, because everyone knew I didn’t worry about getting up in the morning. That’s how I came to be the leader of the anti-social group. We clung to each other as a way of validating our rejection of all those social people. \n",

And the first thing that you do is you actually--at least in Canada, we do things in a very specific way. We have something called a graduated licensing program. I'm sure that the United States does it differently. But you pick up this book and it has all the rules of the road. Yeah, you have to study it because you have to write a written test or something like that. Yeah, it's been a long time. Right, Curtis? It's been a very long time for me, yeah.

He said, “If I have six hours to cut down a tree, then I would spend the first four hours sharpening the axe.” There’s a great philosophy in that. In this era of instant gratification we just keep thinking we can achieve all these goals by just tweaking this, tweaking that, it’s not true. I really believe that a missionary zeal is required to make that quantum change, that can make 2030 of what I’m dreaming about right now. And just let’s look at India as a country, what a unique nation! Seriously. Thousands of years old of culture and tradition, many many invasions, being ruled for many years and we still somehow managed to maintain our identity. We still somehow have managed to maintain our Indian-ness — our beliefs, our faith and you know, yeah, there has been — we have our drawbacks — there is corruption, there is violence, there is differences between the different religions and sects and caste and everything.\n",
