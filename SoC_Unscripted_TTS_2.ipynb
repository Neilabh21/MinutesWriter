            "Truth: President Bok, former President Rudenstine, incoming President Faust, members of the Harvard Corporation and the Board of Overseers, members of the faculty, parents, and especially, the graduates: I’ve been waiting more than 30 years to say this: “Dad, I always told you I’d come back and get my degree.” I want to thank Harvard for this timely honor. I’ll be changing my job next year … and it will be nice to finally have a college degree on my resume. I applaud the graduates today for taking a much more direct route to your degrees. For my part, I’m just happy that the Crimson has called me “Harvard’s most successful dropout.” I guess that makes me valedictorian of my own special class … I did the best of everyone who failed. But I also want to be recognized as the guy who got Steve Ballmer to drop out of business school. I’m a bad influence. That’s why I was invited to speak at your graduation. If I had spoken at your orientation, fewer of you might be here today. Harvard was just a phenomenal experience for me. Academic life was fascinating. I used to sit in on lots of classes I hadn’t even signed up for. And dorm life was terrific. I lived up at Radcliffe, in Currier House. There were always lots of people in my dorm room late at night discussing things, because everyone knew I didn’t worry about getting up in the morning. That’s how I came to be the leader of the anti-social group. We clung to each other as a way of validating our rejection of all those social people. \n",

And it all starts with getting your learner's licence, right Amy? Yeah, definitely. In order to be on the road behind the wheel of a vehicle, you've got to have a license. And the first thing that you do is you actually--at least in Canada, we do things in a very specific way. We have something called a graduated licensing program. I'm sure that the United States does it differently. But you pick up this book and it has all the rules of the road. Yeah, you have to study it because you have to write a written test or something like that. Yeah, it's been a long time. Right, Curtis? It's been a very long time for me, yeah. So, yeah, you have to go in. There's a test that makes sure that obviously you've studied the book, you know about the rules of making a right hand turn, for example, when you need to yield, when you need to stop. All of those sort of things. \n",
